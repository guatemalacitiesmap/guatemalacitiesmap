<p>Rage 2, the adrenaline-fueled first-person shooter, plunges players into a post-apocalyptic wasteland ravaged by the cataclysmic event known as &quot;The Event.&quot; This devastated world, a canvas of crumbling cities and desolate landscapes, serves as the backdrop for a thrilling story of survival, rebellion, and the fight against an oppressive regime.

<p>The Washington D.C. Metro, officially the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), is a vital artery for the nation&#8217;s capital and its surrounding metropolitan area. It&#8217;s a complex network of rail lines, stations, and connections that serve millions of commuters and visitors each day. Understanding the intricacies of the D.C. Metro map is crucial for navigating the city efficiently and exploring its diverse offerings.</p>
<p><strong>Deciphering the Map: A Guide to Lines, Stations, and Transfers</strong></p>
<p>The D.C. Metro map, a visual representation of the system&#8217;s infrastructure, is an essential tool for planning journeys. It features six distinct colored lines:</p>

<li><strong>Blue Line:</strong> Serving northern Virginia, it extends from downtown D.C. to Franconia-Springfield.</li>

</ul>
<p>Each line is visually represented by its distinct color, making it easy to follow on the map.  Stations are denoted by circles, with their names clearly labeled.

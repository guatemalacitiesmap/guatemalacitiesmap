<p>The Dominican Republic, a vibrant nation renowned for its pristine beaches, lush landscapes, and rich cultural heritage, occupies a strategic location in the Caribbean Sea. Situated on the eastern two-thirds of the island of Hispaniola, it shares its island home with Haiti, its western neighbor.

<p>The legacy of Julius Caesar extends far beyond his military conquests and political reforms. He left behind a complex and fascinating world of knowledge, including a map that has captivated historians and scholars for centuries.

<p>Plutarch, another prominent Roman historian, corroborates Suetonius&#8217; account, adding that Caesar&#8217;s map was renowned for its accuracy and comprehensiveness. He describes it as a valuable tool for military planning and administration, highlighting its practical utility beyond mere geographical representation.</p>

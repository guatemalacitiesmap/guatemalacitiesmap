<p><strong>Understanding the City&#8217;s Structure:</strong></p>
<p>Palermo&#8217;s urban fabric is a fascinating blend of ancient and modern, reflected in its map. The city&#8217;s core, known as the <strong>Centro Storico</strong>, is a historical heart surrounded by a series of concentric rings that expand outwards.

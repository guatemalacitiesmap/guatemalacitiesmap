<p>The Murray River, Australia&#8217;s longest river, is a vital artery traversing the continent&#8217;s southeastern landscape. Its journey begins in the Victorian Alps, meandering through the heart of the country, forming the border between Victoria and New South Wales, and finally flowing into the vast expanse of the Coorong in South Australia. This majestic waterway, a lifeline for ecosystems and communities alike, holds profound significance for the Australian landscape and its people.</p>
<p><strong>A River&#8217;s Journey on the Map</strong></p>
<p>To understand the Murray River&#8217;s importance, it&#8217;s crucial to visualize its course on a map. Its source lies in the Snowy Mountains, specifically in the Kosciuszko National Park, where the river emerges as a humble stream. From there, it carves its path through the high country, gaining strength and volume as it gathers tributaries. </p>
<p>As the river descends, it transforms into a major waterway, flowing through the fertile plains of Victoria, where it supports a thriving agricultural industry. The Murray River then forms the border between Victoria and New South Wales, marking a significant cultural and geographical divide.</p>
<p>Continuing its westward journey, the river passes through the Riverina region of New South Wales, a vast agricultural area renowned for its sheep and wheat production. The Murray&#8217;s presence here is vital, providing irrigation for crops and livestock, sustaining a vibrant agricultural economy.</p>
<p>Finally, the river enters South Australia, where it broadens into a vast, shallow system of wetlands and lagoons, known as the Coorong. The Coorong is a unique ecosystem, home to diverse birdlife, including the endangered Australian pelican. Here, the Murray River&#8217;s journey concludes, having traversed over 2,500 kilometers and leaving an indelible mark on the Australian landscape.</p>

<p>The Spratly Islands, a scattered archipelago in the South China Sea, are a focal point of geopolitical tension and a subject of ongoing disputes. These islands, reefs, and sandbars, many of which are submerged at high tide, are strategically significant due to their location in a vital maritime trade route, potential for hydrocarbon reserves, and potential for military bases.</p>
<p><strong>A Complex Geography</strong></p>
<p>The Spratly Islands are a dispersed collection of approximately 100 features, with only a few being large enough to support human habitation. The archipelago is divided into five main groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Spratly Group:</strong> This group, located in the central portion of the archipelago, includes the largest islands, such as Itu Aba (Taiping Island) and Thitu (Pag-asa) Island.</li>
<li><strong>The Dangerous Ground:</strong> This group, located southwest of the Spratly Group, features numerous reefs and shoals.</li>
<li><strong>The Union Banks:</strong> This group, located west of the Spratly Group, includes several large reefs and a few small islands.</li>
<li><strong>The Loaita Bank:</strong> This group, located northeast of the Spratly Group, comprises a large reef system with several submerged features.</li>
<li><strong>The Northeast Cay:</strong> This group, located north of the Spratly Group, includes a single small island.</li>
</ul>

<p>The West Indies, often referred to as the Caribbean, is an archipelago of islands, islets, and cays scattered across the Caribbean Sea.

<p>The indigenous Arawak and Carib peoples, who inhabited the islands before European contact, have left a lasting legacy in language, customs, and traditions.

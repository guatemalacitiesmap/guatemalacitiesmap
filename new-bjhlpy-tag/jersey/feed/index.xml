<p>Pennsylvania and New Jersey, two states nestled along the northeastern coast of the United States, share a complex and intertwined geography. Their shared border, stretching for over 200 miles, is a testament to the historical and cultural connections that bind these two states. A closer examination of their respective landscapes reveals a fascinating tapestry of diverse ecosystems, urban centers, and historical landmarks. </p>
<p><strong>Pennsylvania: A State of Contrasts</strong></p>
<p>Pennsylvania, aptly nicknamed the &quot;Keystone State,&quot; holds a central position in the eastern United States. Its topography is a striking contrast of rolling hills, fertile valleys, and rugged mountains.

<p>The state&#8217;s diverse geology is reflected in its rich natural resources. The vast forests of the Appalachian region are home to a diverse array of flora and fauna, while the fertile valleys along the Susquehanna River and its tributaries are renowned for their agricultural productivity. Pennsylvania&#8217;s eastern region, where the Delaware River defines the state&#8217;s border with New Jersey, features a more urbanized landscape, encompassing major cities like Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. </p>
<p><strong>New Jersey: The Garden State</strong></p>
<p>New Jersey, known as the &quot;Garden State,&quot; is a state of remarkable contrasts, boasting both bustling urban centers and tranquil rural landscapes.

<p>The northern region of New Jersey, known as the &quot;Skylands,&quot; features the state&#8217;s highest elevations, providing a breathtaking panorama of rugged peaks and verdant forests.

Its towering presence symbolized the power of the gods and the city&#8217;s connection to the divine.</p>
<p>Beyond the ziggurat, the city was organized around a network of streets, canals, and public squares.  The presence of numerous temples dedicated to various deities reflects the importance of religion in the lives of the people.

<p>The Las Vegas Strip, a shimmering oasis of neon lights and towering casinos, has become synonymous with entertainment and extravagance. However, its history, like the desert landscape surrounding it, is marked by transformation. To truly appreciate the Strip&#8217;s present grandeur, one must delve into its past, and there is no better tool for this journey than old maps.</p>

<p>Idaho, a state renowned for its rugged beauty, boasts a diverse landscape shaped by the powerful forces of geologic history. At the heart of this grandeur lie its majestic mountain ranges, each with its own unique character and allure. Understanding these ranges and their impact on Idaho&#8217;s environment, economy, and culture requires delving into their intricate tapestry.</p>

<p>Bremen, a city-state in northern Germany, stands as a unique entity within the country&#8217;s federal structure. While most German states encompass both urban and rural areas, Bremen is solely comprised of the city itself and its surrounding port district of Bremerhaven, separated by a stretch of land belonging to Lower Saxony. This unique configuration grants Bremen a distinct identity, marked by its rich maritime history, thriving port, and vibrant urban culture. </p>
